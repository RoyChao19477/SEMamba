### NeurIPS 2024 competition : URGENT challenge 2024 ( oral presentation )

- A speech enhancement (SE) challenge aiming to build universal, robust, diverse, and generalizable SE models.
- The challenge involves diverse distortions, including 
    - **additive noise**, 
    - **reverberation**, 
    - **clipping**,
    - **bandwidth limitations**,  

    with **all types of sampling frequencies** supported by a single model.
- Requires handling a large-scale dataset (~1.5 TB) and includes ranking based on **13 metrics** in classes of 
    - non-intrusive, 
    - intrusive, 
    - downstream-task-independent, 
    - downstream-task-dependent,
    - subjective  

    SE metrics.
- Achieved **4th place** among 70 participating teams (>20 teams joined to the final stage).
- Deliver an oral presentation at the **NeurIPS** 2024 workshop, Vancouver, Canada.
- **Demo website** **[Live Demo Website](https://roychao19477.github.io/speech-enhancement-demo-2024/)**

## ✅ (Updated May 14) Now supports `mamba-ssm 2.2.x`

If you already installed `mamba-ssm 2.2.x`, you can still run this repo with a few modifications:

### Steps to run:
```bash
# Step 1: Copy local override
cp -R mamba_install/mamba_ssm .

# Step 2: Launch training
sh run.sh
```

---

### 🐳 Docker Support

We provide pre-built Docker environments to simplify setup:

1. **x86 systems**
   Tested on A100, RTX 4090, and RTX 3090
   👉 [Visit x86 Docker Repo](https://github.com/RoyChao19477/x86-semamba-docker)

2. **ARM systems**
   Tested on NVIDIA GH200
   👉 [Visit GH200 Docker Repo](https://github.com/RoyChao19477/gh200-semamba-docker)

⚠️  Notice: If you encounter CUDA-related issues while using the Mamba-1 framework, we suggest using the Mamba-2 framework (available in the mamba-2 branch).  
The Mamba-2 framework is designed to support both Mamba-1 and Mamba-2 model structures.

```bash
git checkout mamba-2
```

## Requirement
    * Python >= 3.9
    * CUDA >= 12.0
    * PyTorch == 2.2.2

## Model

## Speech Enhancement Results

## ASR Word Error Rate
We have tested the ASR results using OpenAI Whisper on the test set of VoiceBank-DEMAND.
> The evaluation code will be released in the future.

## Additional Notes

1. Ensure that both the `nvidia-smi` and `nvcc -V` commands show CUDA version 12.0 or higher to verify proper installation and compatibility.

2. Currently, it supports only GPUs from the RTX series and newer models. Older GPU models, such as GTX 1080 Ti or Tesla V100, may not support the execution due to hardware limitations.

## Installation
### (Suggested:) Step 0 - Create a Python environment with Conda

It is highly recommended to create a separate Python environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.
```bash
conda create --name mamba python=3.9
conda activate mamba
```

### Step 1 - Install PyTorch

Install PyTorch 2.2.2 from the official website. Visit [PyTorch Previous Versions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) for specific installation commands based on your system configuration (OS, CUDA version, etc.).

### Step 2 - Install Required Packages

After setting up the environment and installing PyTorch, install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3 - Install the Mamba Package

Navigate to the mamba_install directory and install the package. This step ensures all necessary components are correctly installed.

```bash
cd mamba_install
pip install .
```
📌  Note: You might run `pip install numpy==1.26.4` after these to prevent unpredictable issues.  

⚠️  Note: Installing from source (provided `mamba_install`) can help prevent package issues and ensure compatibility between different dependencies. It is recommended to follow these steps carefully to avoid potential conflicts.

⚠️  Notice: If you encounter CUDA-related issues while you already have `CUDA>=12.0` and installed `pytorch 2.2.2`, you could try mamba 1.2.0.post1 instead of mamba 1.2.0 as follow:
```bash
cd mamba-1_2_0_post1
pip install .
```

## Training the Model
### Step 1: Prepare Dataset JSON

Create the dataset JSON file using the script `sh make_dataset.sh`. You may need to modify `make_dataset.sh` and `data/make_dataset_json.py`.

Alternatively, you can directly modify the data paths in `data/train_clean.json`, `data/train_noisy.json`, etc.

### Step 2: Run the following script to train the model.

```bash
sh run.sh
```

📌  Note: You can use `tensorboard --logdir exp/path_to_your_exp/logs` to check your training log   
📌  Note: If you would like to train SEMamba with the `pretrained_pesq_discriminator` weights, modify the `run.sh` to use the configuration: `--config recipes/SEMamba_advanced/SEMamba_advanced_pretrainedD.pth`.

---

## Using the Pretrained Model

Modify the `--input_folder` and `--output_folder` parameters in `pretrained.sh` to point to your desired input and output directories. Then, run the script.

```bash
sh pretrained.sh
```

## Implementing the PCS Method in SEMamba
> (Updated May 14, 2025) Fix issue: inference.py not parsing bool values correctly
There are two methods to implement the PCS (Perceptual Contrast Stretching) method in SEMamba:
1. Use PCS as Training Target:
- Run the `sh runPCS.sh` with the yaml configuration `use_PCS400=True`.
- Use the pretrained model `sh pretrained.sh` without post-processing `--post_processing_PCS False`.

2. Use PCS as Post-Processing:
- Run the `sh run.sh` with the yaml configuration `use_PCS400=False`.
- Use the pretrained model `sh pretrained.sh` with post-processing `--post_processing_PCS True`.

---

## Evaluation
The evaluation metrics is calculated via: [CMGAN](https://github.com/ruizhecao96/CMGAN/blob/main/src/tools/compute_metrics.py)  

## Perceptual Contrast Stretching
The implementation of Perceptual Contrast Stretching (PCS) as discussed in our paper can be found at [PCS400](https://github.com/RoyChao19477/PCS/tree/main/PCS400).
